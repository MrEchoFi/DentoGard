  <p>
   Ai Powered Tooth Infection Detection using Digital Image with Custom own build Dataset & Algorithm 
  </p>

# Note:
  There is no existence of perfect digital image base dataset of tooth infection! That's why we have to build our own dataset algorithm and dataset. And yeah this is now at 'Model Train' sector! So sometimes the predictions of infection may wrong!!
  But this project is a next gen Ai project and our final target is we will provide a microcontroller based prototype + our app in all dental sectors!
